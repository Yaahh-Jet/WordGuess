# WordGuess using C
This is a **Word Search Game** that challenges players to find hidden words in a grid. It supports three difficulty levels and provides hints to help players. The game keeps track of the score, applies penalties for incorrect guesses, and even includes a **Bonus Round** with emoji-based word puzzles!

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Word Placement**: Words are randomly positioned within the grid.
- **Hint System**: Players can request hints (limited to two).
- **Scoring System**: Points for correct words, penalties for wrong guesses(only in medium and hard level).
- **Bonus Round**: Fun emoji-based word guessing challenge.

### Technologies Used:
- **C Standard Libraries**: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `time.h`
- **Windows-Specific Features**: `windows.h` for colored text output.
- **Randomization & Grid Handling**: Uses `rand()` for word placement.
- **File Handling**: Reads words and hints from text files.

A fun little project!!
