## 🚦 FUNCTION FLOW OVERVIEW

### 🟢 1. main()

*Entry point. Sets up and controls level progression.*

* Calls:

  * srand(time(0)) – Random seed
  * playLevel(...) – For each level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  * bonusRound() – After Hard level
  * Displays final score

---

### 🟡 2. playLevel(filename, level)

*Core gameplay loop per level. Sets difficulty and controls word guessing.*

* Sets:

  * wordCount, gridSize, penalty, maxDirection
* Calls (in order):

  1. clearGrid() – Empty grid
  2. loadWords(filename, wordCount) – Load words and hints from file
  3. placeAllWords() – Tries to place each word in the grid

     * → placeWordInGrid(index) for each word
  4. fillGrid() – Fills empty grid spaces with random letters
  5. displayGrid() – Initial visual
  6. *Game loop (while not all words found)*:

     * Takes user guess
     * Converts to uppercase → toUpper()
     * Checks for "HINT"

       * → provideHint() (if allowed)
     * Matches guess with word list
     * Updates score/penalty
     * → displayGrid() again to show progress

---

### 🔵 3. loadWords(filename, count)

*Reads and parses words and hints from a file.*

* Stores them in global words[] array
* Populates word, hint, and sets found=0
* Returns 1 if success, 0 if not

---

### 🔴 4. placeAllWords()

*Places all words on the grid.*

* Calls placeWordInGrid(i) for each word
* Reports if any word couldn't be placed

---

### 🔶 5. placeWordInGrid(index)

*Tries to place one word in a random position/direction.*

* Uses:

  * directions[dir] based on current maxDirection
* Checks:

  * Bounds
  * Overlap conflicts
* If valid, writes word to grid and updates word's row, col, dir

---

### 🟣 6. fillGrid()

*Fills all empty grid cells with random uppercase letters.*

* Done after all words are placed

---

### 🟤 7. displayGrid()

*Displays the grid with row/column numbers.*

* If a word is marked as found:

  * It uses setColor(10) (green) to highlight its letters
* Calls Sleep(50) for a staggered visual effect

---

### ⚪ 8. toUpper(str)

*Helper to convert user input to uppercase.*

* Prevents case sensitivity issues

---

### 🟠 9. provideHint(word)

*Prints hint for a matching unfound word.*

* Looks up the guessed word
* Displays its associated hint if not yet found

---

### 🟣 10. bonusRound()

*Runs a special emoji-based puzzle.*

* Asks for a compound word based on emojis
* Gives bonus points if answered correctly

### ⚫ 11. setColor(color)

*Changes the console text color (Windows only).*

Brief:

* main() → handles game progression
* playLevel() → controls the core level logic
* File I/O + randomization + grid visualization handled modularly
* Word placement and feedback are dynamic and tied to difficulty
* Use of color and a bonus round adds engagement
